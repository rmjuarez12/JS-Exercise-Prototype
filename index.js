        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window/Global Object Binding: In this principle, if you use "this" without it being inside an specific object, it will
  reference the window object and all its properties.

  2. Implicit Binding: Unlike the Window object binding, principle in here you are referencing a specific Object when you use
  "this" within its properties.

  3. New binding: This principle uses what's called a "constructor function", which is basically a function the creates an object.
  This works like the Implicit Binding principle, but this is used within a function used to construct an object. In this case,
  you have to use reference "this" in all properties' keys, since we are creating a new object from that function.

  4. Explicit binding: With this principle, we use a method named "call()" in order to reference a "parent" constructor in a 
  constructor function. Within the "call()" method, we reference the child constructor by using "this" in the "call()" 
  method.
